# SmartGroceryManager

## A Grocery Management System

This application allows users to ***view*** all products in a grocery store, ***add*** items in the shopping cart and ***purchase*** all selected products. Potential users will mainly include ***everyone*** in the daily life. As this project progresses, an owner portal may be constructed too, thus potential users may also include owners who run this grocery store. The ***reason*** why I am interested in this project is that I feel buying groceries could be tedious and time-consuming sometimes, so the adoption of a well-established grocery management system could make this process more convenient and benefit the public.    <br>
